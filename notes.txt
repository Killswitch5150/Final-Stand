Project Notes:
Development began on 21 October 2024

To do list:
-Figure out how to incorporate animations (player shooting/muzzle flash)
-Clean up code
-Maybe create a player class to simplify in-game actions
-Implement a reloading timer so player can't spam the reload button
-Figure out how to incorporate animations for different states (player shooting/muzzle flash)
-Create more game world visual elements
-Create probability based enemy speeds that become more likely to be fast as waves increase
-Create probability based ammo drops containing different amounts of ammo
-Create different enemy types (some that can shoot, maybe)
-Migrate more set-up data and instructions to a different py/json file, to clean up main code file
-Add more comments so I don't forget what different things do and how to manipulate them
-Add sounds
-Add Settings to main menu to change full screen and other variables
