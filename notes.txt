Project Notes:
Development began on 21 October 2024

To do list:
-Figure out how to incorporate animations (player shooting/muzzle flash)
-Maybe create a player class to simplify in-game actions
-Create more game world visual elements
-Implement more randomness to bush generation
-Add probability of bullet getting "lost in bushes"
-Create different enemy types (some that have more health, maybe)
-Migrate more set-up data and instructions to a different py/json file, to clean up main code file
-Add Settings to main menu to change full screen, volume and other variables
